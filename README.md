# Game of Life Simulator

This Java FX Application simulates John Horton Conway's zero-player game.

The user can draw tiles on the board and click either step (to step once through an evolution) or start (to let the game run until all the tiles have died off, or if the game lands on a scenario that not tiles are deleted).

The user can also erase tiles after the game has started, but the user will have to press the "Stop" button to be able to erase.

After the game is over, the user can click the "Reset" button to bring the board back to its original state and then add or delete tiles to change up how the next game performs.


To use on your own computer:
- Make sure you have java installed on your computer (type `java -version` and `javac -version` in your terminal or command prompt).
- Clone this repo onto your computer.
- Open the cloned repo in an IDE like Eclipse, or (what I used) IntelliJ.
- Allow maven to import all the build dependincies and plugins.
- Navigate to the App.java in the src folder and run.
